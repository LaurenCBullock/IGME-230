### Mechanics ###
The screen will be filled with bubbles of various sizes and the player must pop them all within the alotted amout of turns.
each bubble popped will release a projectile, if it hits another bubble, the size of it increases or if it's at max size it too will pop.
The main idea is to have the player chain as many bubble pops together as possible.
There will also be powerups for the player to intereact with help with chaining together bubble poping or getting bubbles that are in hard to reach places that would be hard for the player to reach
### Control ###
Players will use the mouse to interact with everything in the came.
The bubbles will be popped with a mouse click. Powerups will also be activated with a mouse click.
Menus will also be navigated with the mouse
### Teaching the Game ###
On the menu screen there will be an instructions and controls tab for the player to click to learn to play. the instructions and controls will also pop up before the first level
### Player Learning ###
Powers Ups:
    Instant Pop: immediately pop one bubble - bypass bubble growth stages
    Extra Moves: based on current level, grants 2-7 extra moves
power-ups will spawn at random bubble locations and be granted when bubble is popped.
power-ups will not be required to complete any level but will make completing them easier
